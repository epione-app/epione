# Epione
This is a diary application geared geared toward NZ youth and the ongoing problem with mental health stigma.
## What does it do?
We plan to use [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a way to make our app platform-agnostic.

Ideally we will have tested the app on web, and running natively as app packages on the latest versions Android and iOS.
